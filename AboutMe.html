		<h1 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"><u>About Me</u></h1>
		<p>
		<h2 class= "animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">My name is Owen Jones I am a 22 year old aspiring game developer with an honors degree in the subject who wants to make his name in the industry. I have been making games for many years now when origanally starting on GameMaker Studio when I was around 14. While these projects were very early and not very well refined I continued to persue my intrest in the area. While doing this I also had a 
		very keep intrest in the computer hardware and spent alot of time using Raspberry Pis, building computers and also soldering and finding out how alot of devices really work. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I eventually was able to persue this in an educational setting first starting with taking a Level 3 BETEC in Games Development and 3D Animation in Sixth Form and following it through all the way to a level 6 BSc honors degree in the subject. Throughout this degree I really got to develop my skills as a games developer and my knowledge of the subject area and really find my way in the subject I really enjoyed.
		I came to Relize that the main area that I enjoyed to work in was the programming and more technical side of development such as developing mechanics and working with scripts in unity to create gameplay systems this reaulted in alot of my projects being very complex in that aspect as I really strived to refine my skills and test my abilities (some examples this can be see on the past projects page) This included netcode for multiplayer Systems some VR and Moblie development I worked with and the range of mechanics I included in these games.
		However while it did take a back seat in bigger projects I also really enjoyed the Art side of development even making all the assets for the bigger projects I was creating. This included making 3D Models and designing Characters for my games and other projects. I created these in Maya and really enjoyed learning all the different techniques used in creating 3D Models that I went on to utilize to create Characters with alot of exagguration and in my own unique art style which was a really enjoyable experiance for me 
		(these can also be seen on the poast projects page).
		</p>

		<p>
		I first relized that I wanted to work in the games development industry when I completed The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and it opened my eyes to just how much video games as a medium could do and the experiances that could be created for a player as well as just how much emotion and feeling could be created. This was by far not the first time I felt this way but it really made me relize on a greater scale.
		and is my favourite game to this day because of that. As well as Ocarina of Time I also love the Half Life games for their rich narrative and story that makes the player feel transported in a similar way while offering fun and engaging gameplay to pair with it. Asides from these games I also do really enjoy more competative multiplayer skill driven games one of my favourites being Overwatch 2 that I play quite frequently and enjoy climbing the ranks 
		and having a fun gameplay loop with a host of different characters and ablities to learn and master.
