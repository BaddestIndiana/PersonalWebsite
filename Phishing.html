		<h2 class= "animate slideInLeftCenter animate--faster">A HTML based fishing game where the player controls a lure and must catch as many fish as they can with different mechanics and gameplay elements</h2>
		<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--faster">
			In this game the player plays as a fishermans' lure that is cast into the sea and they must avoid fish that are trying to get caught. When the player hits a fish they start being pulled back up and must catch all the fish they were just avoiding to gain as many points as they can until they are at the surface.
			This is a simple idea that has been seen before, however I hope to put my own spin on this idea in different ways and have it hosted on this site to play. <br>
			This Game is my main priority right now, below are the links to the Jira for the project, the GitHub with the scripts created so far and a link to a detailed design document I have made for the project explaining the game mechanics, inspiration, style and other important aspects. I also have my twitter link where I post updates and progress on my work regularly.
			<br>
			A Playable version of the game will be available to play on this website when it is getting closer to the end of development with some of the less important features missing that will be implemented later on.
