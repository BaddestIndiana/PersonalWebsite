		<h2 class= "animate slideInLeftCenter animate--faster">A HTML based fishing game where the player controls a lure catch as many fish as they can with different mechanics and gameplay elements</h2>
		<h3 class= "animate slideInLeftCenter animate--faster">In this game the player plays as a fisherman who casts a lure into the sea and must dodge the fish to make the lure sink deeper into the sea, then when the player hits a fish they work to hit all the fish they were just avoiding to gain as many points as they can.
		This is a simple idea that has been seen before, However I hope to put my own spin on this idea in different ways and have it hosted on this site to play. <br>
		This Game is my main priority right now, below is the links to the Jira for the project, the Gitbub with the scripts created up todays date and a link to a detailed design document I have made for the project explaing the game mechanics, insperation, style and other important aspects. I also have my twitter link where I post Updates and progress on my work regularly. 
		<br>
		A Playable version of the game will be avalible to play on this website when it is getting closer to the end of development with maybe some of the less important features missing that will be implemented later in developemnt.
