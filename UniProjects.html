	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
		JetSki Joyride was a mobile game I created for an assignment in university where I was tasked to create a game for android specifically. For this I decided to utilise the phones gyroscope to control a jetski in a racing game. This was heavly inspired by games like wave race 64 for the N64. For the game I created three levels each each with increasing difficulty that were layed out in a kind of
		grand prix setting. These levels also used a shader I created following a tutorial and different videos online that helped me to create an accurate wave simulation. This then worked in combonation with a scipt that uses the data from the shader to create an accurate collision for the simulated water. This meant the player and NPC racers in the game would kind of float on the surface of the shader and worked well in practise.
		For the racing aspect of the game I used checkpoints that the player could see visualy to help them around the level and they would also be used by the npcs to create a path for them to follow. These worked in hand with an integer on all the racers to count the amount of waypoints everyone had gone through adding one on the collision of a waypoint so that I could find out who was in front and
		display it on the top of the screen so the player knew if they were first, second or third. This project gave me alot of learning experiance and problems to solve that I had not thought of before due to development being on a different platform, this being android. I also gained my first real experiance using shaders in intresting ways and using there data in separate game scripts that I carried forward to other projects.

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">VR Demon Shooter</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
		Another smaller project I created was a VR shooter in Unity using the Steam VR asset package. This was quite a simple game where the player would be equipt with a pistol and have to defend themselves from floating demons above there head in a hellscape environment. The game included a timer
		and the player was tasked to kill as many demons as they could in the 30 seconds they were given. Utilising the Steam VR package was a good learning experiance and helped me to understand how VR games are created using Unity in industry and how different more nechie VR systems such as VR Controller calls are handeled. This project may have been quite small
		when it was completed but the experiance and knowledge gained was very valuable.
