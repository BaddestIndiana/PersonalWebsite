	<h1 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"><u>Smaller Projects</u></h1>
	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Some small proejcts that I did while in University or that are smaller and were more specific when it comes to utilization of my skills</h2>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Mobile JetSki Racing Game</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">JetSki Joyride was a mobile game I created for an assignment biult for android specifically and that used the phones gyroscope to control your jetski in the game. this was heavly inspired by wave race 64 for the N64. In the game there are three levels each getting harder as you progress through in a kind of 
	grand prix like setting. These levels also used a shader I created following a tutorial and different videos on creating shaders to create a wave shader that would worked in combonation with a scipt that uses the data from the shader to create an acurate water simulation that the player and npcs would colide with and be able to drive on.
	for the racing I used checkpoints that the player could see visualy to help them around the level and they would also be used by the npcs for to create a path for them to follow I also used an integer on all there to count the amount of waypoints everyone has gone through adding one on the collision of a waypoint so that I could find out who was in front and
	display it on the top of the screen so the player knew there progress. This whole project was a great experiance for me as it gave me alot of learning experiance and problems to solve with development being on the android platform, using shaders in intresting ways and making NPCs that a player would compete against.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">VR Demon Shooter</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Another smaller project I created was a vr shooter in unity using the Steam VR package from the unity asset store. this was quite a simple game where the player would be equipt with a pistol and have to defend themselves from floating demons above there head in a hell scape environment. the game included a timer
	for the player and the player would have to kill as many demons as they could in the 30 seconds they were given. using the Steam VR package was a really good learning experiance and helped me to understand how VR games were created and made in unity for a steam realese and also how different systems such as VR controller calls. This project may have been quite small
	when it was completed but the experiance and testing of my knowledge was very valuable.</h3>
