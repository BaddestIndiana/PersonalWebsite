	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">An intro cutscene animation for a fish based fighting game</h2>
	<p>
		<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
			This animation was made for an assignment during my degree in games development. In this Assignment I was tasked with making a basic animation in Maya, that would act as a intro cutscene to a game idea of my choice.
			For this I also decided to create the models, rigs, Block-out and full storyboard for the project. This was not a requirement but I saw it as a chance to refine my skills and make sure that the project fit a vision I had that could only be realised by creating the assets myself. I found the project very enjoyable to work on as I had to use most of the different aspects of Maya and 3D creation software,
			such as key framing, rigging, making controls and modeling to name a few. This gave me a good chance to practise my already established skills and create an end product I was proud of.

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Preproduction </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
		As mentioned above the Pre-production stage came first on my agenda, for this I started by brainstorming some themes I wanted to create and I came to the idea of an animation depicting fish in a tank. This idea was inspired by the old Fish simulator PC games that were popular in the early 2000s as I felt that they always had alot of character and charm. At the time of brainstorming I also had recently been playing the game
		Insaniquarium, an old PC game about owning a fishtank but with a wacky setting.
		Inspired by this I decided to make an animation with a new spin on the exaggurated fish tank theme. This ended up being a fish fighting game idea as I believed it could allow me to make something pretty unique and stylized. After this the next step was creating a story based around this setting and brainstorming some characters. With this I decided
		on having a Goldfish as the main character to act as a sort of underdog who is thrown into a tank of fish and has to climb up the ranks fighting all the different types of fish you would see in an aquariums fish tank.
		With it being an intro cutscene I was creating I also needed a clear enemy to act as the kind of "big bad" who would go against the player and give them a reason to want to fight.
		I eventually settled on having a kind of "fish mafia" in the animation who run the tank as a play on classic mafia media and films, this led to the idea of having a big mob boss fish who is accompanied by two smaller mafioso styled fish that have a patten on there skin resembling old 70s and 80s mafia suits. This is when the whole idea started coming together and I began work on the 
		story that would play out around these characters during the cut-scene. Using a classic three act structure as a base I decided the goldfish underdog would start off being cast into a new tank inside an aquarium, after sinking to the bottom he is captured by the mafia boss and beat up by his goons to be left for dead. However a sea slug notices what's going on and comes to the rescue to save our protaganist taking him away to be trained in the art of fighting,
		We then see the games name revealed "Fish Fight Fest".<br> The storyboard for this can be seen on the YouTube video link below <br>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Modeling </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
		The first bit of modeling I did for the project was a block-out of the characters and environment so I could start to put my ideas into fruition, these were some simple models and textures that would be rigged and animated to later be replaced with the final more detailed assets.
		These detailed models can also be seen below. When Modeling I used an exaggurated style to fit the games' tone, this allowed me to do alot with the character designs and make something that stands out, which I enjoy doing in all the work I create.

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Rigging </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> When starting the rigging for the project I firstly drew out the bones in maya for all the models that were going to be animated, this was done using the create bones tool while in the front viewport. While doing this I made sure that the bones were in apropriate places on the objects so they could be animated correctly, for example the fishes' bones needed to be placed so the model could be accurately animated to waggle similar to how they swim in real life. 
	I then bound the bones to the meshs and began painting the skin weights so that the bones would move more accurately in association with where they were placed. The last step of the rigging process was the creation of the controls so  
	the rigs could be animated easily and accurately without modifying the world space values. Seeing my work come together like this was very enjoybale and a good test of my knowledge in maya and 3D Modeling and Rigging.

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Animating </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> 
	When it came to animating I made sure to keep refrencing the sketches and storyboard I had created, so that the final product would end up fitting the structure I had planned out in my original vision. The first bit of animating I did was the blockouts' animation, this was more simple than the final products animation and was just to get a basic idea of how it 
	would look and come together later, as well as what I could add or refine. 
	I animated by key-framing controls in maya making sure that I was accounting for time and how long certain parts of the animation were going to play out for. After fully animatiing the blockout (seen below in the video) I decided that ceratin parts of the animation could be improved upon.
	This included the implimentation of a few new scenes that helped to add to the narrative, such as the added POV of someone hidden behind a rock watching the fight play out who is later revealed to be the sea slug that takes our main charcter in. In the final product I also worked to add some more key-frames that would help to bring the animation to life, these included small movements on the fish while swimming to make them look alot less robotic. 
	These animations can both be seen in the video links below. <br>
