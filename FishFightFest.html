	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">A intro cutscene animation for a fish based fighting game</h2>
	<p>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">This animation was made also for my degree where the assignment was to make a basic animation in maya, that would act as a intro cutscene to a game idea of our choice
	For this I also decided to model, rig Block-out and fully storyboard for the project, not as a requirement but to refine and learn new skills and make sure that the project fit the vision I had for the project. It was a fun project to work on as I used most of the different aspects of Maya and 3D creation software 
	such as key framing, rigging making controls and modeling to name a few utilized to create the end product.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Preproduction </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> As mentioned above the Preproduction stage came first on my agenda for this I started by brainstorming some ideas of what I wanted to create and I came to the conclution with some insparation from old Fish simulator PC games as I felt that they use to have alot of character and at the time I had recently been reminded of the game
	Insaniquarium an old PC game about owning a fishtank but with a wacky setting. Inspirted by this I wanted to make a story with my own spin on it that being a fish fighting game as I believed it could allow me to make something pretty unique and stylized. After this the next step was creating the story based around this setting and brainstorming some characters. With this I decided
	on having a Goldfish as the main character to act as a sort of underdog who is thrown into this tank of fish and has to climb up the ranks fighting all the different types of fish you would see in a fish tank. With it being an intro cutscene I was creating I decided I needed a clear enemy to act as a kind of big bad the player would hate and strive to take down. 
	I settled on haveing a kind of like fish mafia who run the tank as a play on classic mafia media and films, with this I also came up with the idea of having a big kind of mob boss fish who is acompanied by two smaller fishes that have a patten on there skin resembling old 70s and 80s mafia suits. this is when it started all coming together and I started to design a short
	story around the cahracters for the cut scene following a classic three act structure. Whereby the fish starts off being cast into a new tank inside a Aquarium then is captured by the mafia boss and beat up by his goons then left for dead. However a sea slug comes to the rescue and saves our protaganist taking him away to be trained in the art of fighting
	and as we see this the games name is revealed "Fish Fight Fest".<br> The storyboard for this can be seen on the YouTube video link below <br>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Modeling </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> The first bit of modeling for the project was a block-out characters and the environment so I could satrt to put my ideas into real fruition these were some simple models and textures that would be rigged and animated to later be replaces with the update more detailed models.
	These detailed models can aslo be seen below. These were created in a exaggurated style to fit the setting of the game that I set out to create and allowed me to put my own spin on my creations which I really enjoy doing in all my work I create.

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Rigging </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> For the rigging in the project I drew out bones for all the models using the create bones tool in the front viewport makeing sure that the bones were in apropriate places on the object so they could be animated appropriately, for example the fishes bones allowing the fish to waggle there bodies to swim similar to how they move in real life. 
	and then bound them to the mesh then painted the skin weights so that the bones would move more accurately in association with where the bones were placed. In the body so the rigs were acurate and the best they could be so the animation would look smooth and well made. The last step of the rigging process was the creation of the controls so that 
	I could move the bones on all the rigs easily without modifying the world space values while animating and allows me to more accurately animate modifiying the different values from zero making the process alot easier. Seeing my work come together like this was very enjoybale and a good use of my knoledge of maya and 3D Modeling and Rigging.

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> Animating </h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"> 
	When it came to finally animating the I made sure to keep refrencing the sketches and storyboard I had made so that the final text fitted the structure I had planned for the project the first bit of animating for the project was for the blockout animationthis was more simple than the animating for what would be the final animation and was just to get a basic idea of how it 
	would look and come together later in the project and give me an idea of what I could add and improve upon. I animated by keyframing controls in maya making sure that I was acounting for time and how long certain parts of the animation were going to play out for. after fully animatiing this seen in the video below I decided that ceratin parts of the animation could be improved upon
	this Included the implimentation of a few new scenes that helped to add to the narrative such as the added POV of someone hidden behind a rock watching the fight play out who is later revealed to be the sea slug that takes our main charcter in. In the fianl text I also worked to add some more key frames in to bring the animation to life making small movements that werent there in the first 
	animation, to add some realisum and make the animation look alot less robotic. These animations can both be seen in the video links below. <br>
