	<h1 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"><u>Character Designing Project</u></h1>
	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">My own character modeled, rigged and animated in maya</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">In this project I was tasked with creating a character from the ground up, this involved the designing, modeling, rigging, animating and all the other elements that go into creating a character in a professional and industry setting.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Pre-Production</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">The pre-production stage of the project included alot of character designing and brainstorming of ideas to see what looked good and what didn't or wouldn't in the long run. The first step was putting my many ideas into sketches, as from the start I knew I wanted to create something alien like that I could 
	give a stylized and exaggerated look, which is my favourite thing to do in chatacter creation. I took full creative control and put alot of effort into making these and they ended up being very useful as the final design would incorporate all my favourite features I thought up in this process,
	such as extruded legs, an oversized head and improportionate limbs. After this final character was in mind I began planning out how he would look in a 3D setting from each axis and how I would create him as a 3D object. This included drawing a rough outline of the faces that would build up the character, how the character would look in a 3D space and how the rig would be laid out.
	These plans can be seen below.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Modeling</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">The modeling for the character started with me box modeling a humanoid base with hips, a chest, shoulders and a neck while making sure the topology was correct and designed with the rig in mind. While modeling I worked to create the design accurate to how I orignally envisioned and planned, I did this by constantly refrencing my original sketches and idea, creating the rounded stomach, some nipple bumps and 
	a spine that bends. 
	After this I used the mirror tool to create the limbs for the creature, starting with the arms that I made long and spindely with more edge loops at the elbows so that they would bend easily with the rig later on. When it came to the hands I also followed this technique making the fingers long and only having three with the middle one being the longest.
	Next was the legs these were designed to start quite wide and get smaller as they went down ending at the aliens' small three toe feet.
	Lastly once I had the body I moved on to the neck, this was again very stylized starting wide getting smaller and then opening up again for the head to be created on top of it. The head was created by extruding up from the neck as a base and then using the mirror tool to add details
	such as small exaggerations like the forehead lumps and other features that help to give some character to the model. 
	After it was all finished and UVed I used the decimate tool to make a low poly version of the character as the assignment required it. This was due to how in industry we would need lower and higher qauilty models
	for different game settings and hardware. This process was one of the last things that I did so that the textures and rigs would match and they could be used simultaneously in a game setting.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Texturing</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">The first step of the texturing process was creating a good UV map layout for the faces of the model. I started this process by creating seams in different parts of the model so that I could easily separate them into there own UV Shells, this was done for the legs, arms, feet and hands. This meant that I could not only texture
	them correctly but also have a nice layed out map that was not only professional but could be reused in later projects. After this I began to use the select UV Shell tool in combination with the planar mapping tool too capture the different faces on the UV map, I then used UV unwrapping to lay the faces out and create a simple texutre map. 
	Once this was done it was exported and opened in Krita the raster graphics editor software to be textured, the final texture can be seen below. </h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Rigging</h2>	
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">When creating the rig I wanted to make it very complex so that I could animate unique parts of the model, such as the nipples and fingers that are not rigged on human IK set-ups. I first started off by creating the spine and neck of the skeleton in the front view making sure I included enough bones for the character to be animated correctly later on. 
	I then started to create the limbs for one side of the model these being the arm, leg and then the fingers and toes connected to them. I then mirrored these bones to the opposite side of the model making sure they were parented correctly and bound the whole skeleton to the mesh when the bones were aligned.

	Once this was done I realised that the painting of the skin weights would be quite a process, however I got started straight away in crafting my vision by fixing the majority of the created skin weights and fully repainting some bones such as the fingers and feet that did not bind correctly due to the faces being closer together. In the end it came together very well and I was able to create skin weights that were smooth and accurate, 
	I loved this process as it allowed me to practice my weight painting and was a good challenge for me.
	Next I got to creating controls for all the different bones that would later be used to animate the character, these were intricately made so that even the small parts of the charater could be controlled and moved without effecting there world position of the bone, it was a long process but well worth it for the end result.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Animating</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Before I started animating I made copies of the origianl maya file and renamed them based on the different animations I had to create for the assignment, These animations were designed to be used in a game setting. These were an idle animation, a walking animation, a running animation, a death animation and an attack animation
	these were simple animations just to show how the rig was usable in a professional setting and how it could be easily and accurately animated, you can watch these below. Creating these was not only a good experiance and test of my skills but also made me more confident and is one of the reasons I began creating my own models and rigs for other projects.
