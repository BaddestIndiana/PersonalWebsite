	<h1 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow"><u>Character Designing Project</u></h1>
	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">My own character designed modeled and rigged</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">In this project I created a Alien character from the ground up designing, modeling, rigging and all the other elements that go into creating a character in a professional and industry setting.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Pre-Production</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">The preproduction stage for this project included alot of character designing and testing the waters to see what looked and flet good and what didnt in the long run. The first step was putting ideas out there as I from the start had the idea that I wanted to create something alien like as I would be able
	to make something stylized and original and it is also my favourite type of chatacter to make. this is where I started sketching up some rough ideas that later I would pull from to create the final character design later in the process. I took full creative control when making these and the final design incorporated all my favourite features I thought up in this process
	such as Extruded legs a oversized Head and improportionate limbs. After this final character was in mind I began planning out how he would look in a 3D setting from each axis and how I would create him as a 3D object. This included drawing a rough outline of the faces that would biuld up the characer, how the character would look in a 3D space and how the rig would be layed out.
	these plans can be seen below.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Modeling</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">The modeling process for the character started with me box modeling a basic character base starting with the hips chest shoulders and neck making sure the topology was correct and designed with the final rig in mind. I worked to create the design in this exaggurated style creating a rounded stomach some nipple bumps and 
	a spine that bends around to make it look that bit more alien that I was trying to capture. After this I used the mirror tool to create the limbs for the creature, starting with the arms making them long and spindely with more edge loops at the elbows for the arms to bend. When it came to the hands I also followed this technique making the fingers long and only having three with the middle one being the longest
	Next were the legs these were designed to start quite wide and get smaller as I went down the leg finishing with smaller feet similar to the hands. lastly once I had the body I moved on to the neck that was made to be very stylized starting wide getting smaller and then opening up again for the head to be created on top of it. the head was created with the mirror
	tool making sure to add small exaggurations in such as the forehead lumps and other small details such as the bumps on his head. After it was all finished and UVed I used the decimate tool to make a lower poly version of the charater as the assignment required it as if we were creating for a game in industry we would need a lower qauilty model and a higher 
	for different game settings and hardware. this process was one of the last things that I did so that the texutres and rigs would match so they could be used simultaneously in a game setting.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Texturing</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">With the texturing the first step was creating a good UV map to texture the faces of the model, firstly I started to cut and create seams in different parts of the model so that I could easily separate parts of the model into there own UV Shells such as the legs, arms, feet and hands so that I could not only texture
	them correctly but also have a nice layed out map meaning the model was not only professional but could be reused in some way in later projects. After this I began to use the select UV Shell tool to project the different faces on the right axis I then used the UV unwrap tool and layed them out on the UV map and created a simple texutre in Krita the raster graphics editor software for the model thatcan be seen below. </h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Rigging</h2>	
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">With the rig of the model I wanted to make it very complex and unique this meant making and laying out the rigs structure myself and not using the auto rigging feature and biulding apone it. I first started off with the main bodies skeleton so the spine and head making sure I had enough bones to so he could be animated well later on 
	after it was drwan out. I then used the tool to create the limbs for one side of the model with the arms legs inluding the fingers and toes and it would then be mirrored to the oposite side and connected to the spine. after this I bound the skeleton to the skin making sure the bones were aligned with the parts of the mesh. Once this was done I relized that the painting of The
	skin weights would be quite a process however I got started straight away in crafting my vision fixing the majority of the created skin weights and having to fully repaint some bones such as the fingers and feet that did not bond correctly due to the faces being closer. However after all this it came together very well and I was able paint the skin weights accurately 
	to be animated accurately and smoothly. After this was done I got to creating controls for all the different bones that would later be used to animate my character these were intricately made so that even the small parts of the charater could be controlled and moved without effecting there world position it was a long process but well worth it for the end result.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Animating</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Once I started animating I made copies of the origianl maya file and renamed them based on the different animations I had to create for the project so that the charater could be implemented into a game setting. These were a idle animation, a walking animation, a running animation, a death animation and an attack animation
	these were simple anaitmaions just to show how the rig was usable in a professional setting and was made well so that it could be easily and accurately animated. you can watch these below, I spent time to make sure these were acurate and good looking so that the character could maybe be implmented into a future game i would create and if not it was a good experiance and test of my skills.
