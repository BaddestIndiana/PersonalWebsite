	<p>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Frog Game was created for a project while I was undergoing my Games Development and 3D Animation dagree, In this project I was tasked with creating a fully working game that could test alot of my skills and allow me to show my poasstion and exercise my knowledge of Games Development 
	This Project Utilized a range of different Games Development knowledge and skills. 
	in the form of the large amount of assets that I created and used in the game including the Models, Netcode, Game Machnics and Scripts.
	This was one of the funnest projects I had done at the time as it was my first project where I could fully control alot of the aspects of the project and was a great experiance for me

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Modeling</h2>
	<p>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">I also had a great time creating and designing the 3D Models that can be seen below, these were created in a stylized way to make the game apealing and give it a light hearted tone on first impression
	These models were rigged using mixamo auto rigger and were given animations from the mixamo animation library, they were then placed in the game and set up to work with scripts as well as given a cell shaded shader I created.</h3>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Work Ethic</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">While creating this as I was working at Univercity I wanted to follow alot of Idustry standards as good practice, This included using Trello to keep track of my work and what needed to be completed as well as a design document so that I always had a refrence to refer back to when creating so that the game fit the original vision when fully created and didnt stray from my original ideas. These were submitted along with the assignment and I made sure to carry this thought process on to my future projects at it helped the development alot.</h3>
	<div class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
	</div>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">The Game is available right now for download on my Itch.IO link here and the servers are still up, A detailed look at the assets created is also available on my GitHub and Artstation, Thank you for reading</h3>
