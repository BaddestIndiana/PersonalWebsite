		<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
			Frog Game was created while I was undergoing my Games Development and 3D Animation dagree, In this project I was tasked with creating a fully working game in Unity that would allow me to show my passion and exercise my knowledge of Games Development.
			As a result I created all of the main assets for the project these being the Models, Netcode, Game Machnics and Scripts.
			This was one of the most enjoyable projects I had done at the time as it was my first project where I could fully control every aspect of development and was a great learning experience.

	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">
		The photos below show a look into the scripts that were created to handle the multiplayer aspect of the game and make it work efficantly. For the project I utilised the Pun2 Unity asset package to give me some base net-code libraries that I could use when scripting and creating the multiplayer system, this was done as it was the best multiplayer system for Unity at the time.
		These scripts, and the other more basic scripts that handled aspects such as player movement and attacking can be found on my GitHub linked below.<br>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Modeling</h2>
	<p>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">I also had a great time creating and designing the 3D Models that can be seen below, these were given a stylized look to make the game apealing and give it a light hearted tone that fits with the games theme.
	These models were rigged using the Mixamo auto rigger and were given animations from the Mixamo animation library, they were then placed in the game and set up to work with my scripts as well as given a cell shaded, shader I created. A post on the creation and development of these models can be found on my art station page linked below.<br>

	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">Work Ethic</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">During development I followed alot of Idustry standards as good practice, This included using Trello to keep track of my work and what needed to be completed as well as a design document so that I always had a refrence to refer back to when creating. These were submitted along with the assignment and I made sure to carry this thought process on to my future projects as it helped me to stay on top of the
		development process.</h3>
