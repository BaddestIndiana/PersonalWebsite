	<h2 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">A collection of Basic Scipts</h2>
	<h3 class="animate slideInLeftCenter animate--slow">These scripts were made to be implemented in any project and set up a basic system for more back-end parts of development. these being a script for Video settings, Audio Settings and Saving and Loading data to a .json file. <br>I created these scripts as I often felt that when I was making new projects in Unity I would
	be creating the same smilar sort of scripts over and over before getting to the unique development of each project that I wanted to be doing so instead I created an asset package with some of the basic must use unity scripts that could be easily implemented. These scripts were also created in mind of this as the allow the user to fill in what they need the script to do in the unity inspector instead of editing the script directly
	this not only saved time and allowed for easy use of the features but also was made so people who didnt really script or have knoledge of the unity libraries could understand it and still implement it. Below you can see these scripts as well as a link to my GitHub Where the scripts are available.
