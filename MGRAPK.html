		These scripts were made to be implemented in any project and set up a basic system for back-end parts of game development. These being scripts for Video settings, Audio Settings and Saving and Loading data to a .json file. <br>I created these scripts as I often felt that when I was making new projects in Unity I would
		be creating the same sort of scripts over and over before getting to the unique and fun parts of development that made each project different. So instead I created an asset package with some of the basic must use Unity system scripts that could be easily implemented in any project. These scripts were also written with easy implementation in mind and allow the user to fill in what they need the script to do in the unity inspector instead of editing the script directly.
		This not only saves time for the user it also allows for easy use of the features so people who don't really use C# or have little knowledge of the Unity libraries could understand it and still implement it with ease. Below you can see these scripts as well as a link to my GitHub Where the scripts are available.
