	<h3 class= "animate slideInLeftCenter animate--faster">ClayBoys is a Rouge like Charater Biulding game where players are tasked with becoming a old western bounty hunter in a clay wild west, they will fight through multiple randomly generated western environemnts and fight randomly generated bosses that will drop loot for players to collect including randomly made guns and different 
	cosmetics. 
	<p>
	The player can equip and combine with other items to create a unique and refined character that is defined around there own style of how they want to play the game such a fast hitting and fast moving gun slinger or a more slow heavy kind of biuld. This is still in early stages of development right now but the final game is going to hopefully be a fun experiance
	that people can play with there friends on steam in the near future.
