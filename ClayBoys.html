	<h2 class= "animate slideInLeftCenter animate--faster">A Multiplayer Rogue-Like With an Old Western Cowboy setting and a Clay Art Style</h2>
	<h3 class= "animate slideInLeftCenter animate--faster">Clay-Boys is a rogue-like character building game where players are tasked with becoming old western bounty hunters in a clay wild west, in the game they will travel through multiple western themed environments and fight randomly generated bosses that will drop loot to collect including guns and different 
	cosmetics. While progressing in the game the players will have to equip and combine items they find to create unique characters based around there own play styles, such as quick shooting pistols for the fast moving gun slinger or large miniguns for the more slow heavy characters. This is still in early stages of development right now but the final game is going to hopefully be a fun experience
	that people can play with their friends on Steam in the near future.
